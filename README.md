# Univariate-Time-Series-COVID-19-Predictions

Date: Winter 2020

Machine Learning Project. Given a 1-week deadline, the project involved predicting the future cumulative number of confirmed cases, deaths, and recovered cases based on the COVID-19 data available on the John Hopkins github repository. The goal is to tell a data-driven story in a Jupyter notebook while making predictions as accurate as possible. While the focus is on univariate models, each approach is explored and compared against each other to identify which models have the best fit. Both text and code is presented to show revelations in data patterns, justifications, as well as overall findings.
