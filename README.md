# Univariate Time Series Forecasting: COVID-19 Predictions

**Author:** Atlanta Liu

**Date:** Winter 2020

### What's in this repository?

Personal submission for a machine learning project. Given a 1-week deadline, the project involved predicting the future cumulative number of confirmed cases, deaths, and recovered cases for Canada based on the COVID-19 data available on the John Hopkins github repository. The goal is to tell a data-driven story in a Jupyter notebook while making predictions as accurate as possible. All predictions are made through  comparison of multiple univariate models to identify which has the best overall fit (highest mean squared error) leading up to the last 3 days. Both text and code is presented alongside to provide revelations in data patterns, justifications for each approach, as well as overall findings from our project.
